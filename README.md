# Sentiment Analysis of Federal Reserve Rate Cut Coverage Using AWS

## Introduction

Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, financial news outlets and analysts produced extensive coverage through written articles and video commentary. While these sources report on the same economic event, differences may arise in tone, framing, and emotional emphasis.

This project analyzes sentiment across major news outlets and compares written reporting with spoken commentary from YouTube videos. Managed AWS services are used to process multilingual text, transcribe audio content, and extract sentiment indicators in a reproducible data engineering pipeline.

## Research Question

How does sentiment differ across major news outlets when covering the same Federal Reserve interest rate decision, and how does sentiment in spoken commentary compare to written reporting?

---

## Data Sources

### News Articles
- CNN
- CNBC
- Reuters
- BBC
- Der Standard (German-language article, translated to English)

### YouTube Videos
- Fox News
- CNN
- CNBC (Fast Money and News segments)
- Reuters (Federal Reserve Chair press conference)

## AWS Services Used

- Amazon S3 – cloud storage for raw and processed data
- Amazon Translate – translation of non-English text
- Amazon Comprehend – sentiment analysis
- Amazon Transcribe – speech-to-text transcription

## Methodology and Tools

The analysis follows a multi-stage data engineering workflow:

1. News articles are scraped using Python and BeautifulSoup.
2. Non-English content is translated into English using Amazon Translate.
3. YouTube audio files are transcribed using Amazon Transcribe.
4. Sentiment analysis is performed using Amazon Comprehend.
5. Intermediate and final outputs are stored in Amazon S3.
6. Results are aggregated and visualized using pandas and matplotlib.

This approach enables a consistent comparison of sentiment across sources and content formats.


### Data Collection: News Articles

News articles were scraped directly from publisher websites using Python. The goal was to extract full article text for downstream analysis.

```python
def scrape_article(url):
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    return " ".join(
        p.get_text(strip=True) for p in soup.find_all("p")
    )
```
---
### Translation with Amazon Translate

To ensure comparability across sources, non-English articles were translated into English using Amazon Translate. This step standardizes the input language for sentiment analysis.
```python
response = translate.translate_text(
    Text=raw_text[:4500],
    SourceLanguageCode="auto",
    TargetLanguageCode="en"
)

translated_text = response["TranslatedText"]
```
---
### Speech-to-Text Transcription with Amazon Transcribe

Spoken commentary from YouTube videos was converted into text using Amazon Transcribe. Audio files were first uploaded to Amazon S3, as Transcribe operates on cloud-stored media.
```python
transcribe.start_transcription_job(
    TranscriptionJobName=job_name,
    Media={"MediaFileUri": s3_uri},
    MediaFormat="mp3",
    LanguageCode="en-US"
)
```
### Storing Transcription Outputs

Once Amazon Transcribe completed the speech-to-text process, the resulting transcripts were saved locally as text files and uploaded to Amazon S3 for persistent storage and reproducibility.

```python
# Ensure local output folder exists
os.makedirs("output/txt", exist_ok=True)

# Save transcript locally
transcript_path = f"output/txt/{source_name}_transcript.txt"
with open(transcript_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(transcript_text)

# Upload transcript to S3
s3.upload_file(
    transcript_path,
    bucket_name,
    f"output/txt/{source_name}_transcript.txt"
)
```

### Sentiment Analysis with Amazon Comprehend
Amazon Comprehend was used to extract sentiment scores from both written articles and transcribed audio. Each text was assigned probabilities across four categories:
-  **Positive**
-  **Negative**
-  **Neutral**
-  **Mixed**

### Access to Stored Data (Amazon S3)

All raw and processed outputs generated by the pipeline are stored in Amazon S3.
These include scraped articles, translated texts, audio transcripts, sentiment results,
cost summaries, and generated visualizations.

S3 bucket (AWS Console ):
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/2404422-news-sentiment

Access requires valid AWS credentials and appropriate IAM permissions.

## Results and Visualizations

This section presents the results of the sentiment analysis applied to news articles and YouTube news videos discussing the recent U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Sentiment scores were generated using **Amazon Comprehend** and aggregated to compare patterns across media formats and news sources.

### 5. Sentiment Polarization Index

![Sentiment Polarization Index](output/graphs/graph_5_polarization_index.png)

The sentiment polarization index is defined as:
```
 Positive sentiment score − Negative sentiment score
```
Higher values indicate a more optimistic framing, while lower values indicate a more pessimistic framing.

### Sentiment Polarization by Source and Content Type

| Content Type | Source            | Polarization Index |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Article      | bbc               | +0.04              |
| Article      | cnn               | ≈ 0.00             |

Several clear patterns emerge from the sentiment polarization table.

#### Articles: Low Polarization and Neutral Framing

Written news articles exhibit polarization values clustered tightly around zero. This indicates a predominantly neutral framing of Federal Reserve interest rate decisions across publishers. Minor deviations in either direction suggest limited emotional emphasis, consistent with traditional journalistic norms in economic reporting.

Notably:
- BBC and Reuters articles show slightly positive polarization.
- The German-language article displays a marginally negative tone after translation.
- Overall variance among articles remains low.

#### YouTube Content: Stronger Emotional Framing

In contrast, YouTube news content demonstrates substantially higher dispersion in polarization values. Both strongly positive and strongly negative sentiment framing appear within video-based sources.

Key observations include:
- CNN and CNBC video segments exhibit pronounced negative polarization.
- Fox News content shows a strong positive polarization.
- Reuters’ video content lies between these extremes.

This pattern suggests that video-based news formats emphasize emotional framing more aggressively than written articles, likely due to differences in audience engagement strategies and presentation style.

#### Content Format vs Publisher Identity

Importantly, sentiment differences are driven more by **content format** than by publisher identity. The same media organizations often display neutral sentiment in written articles but polarized sentiment in video content. This indicates that the medium itself plays a central role in shaping sentiment expression around monetary policy topics.



**Results:**
- Articles generally have polarization values close to zero.
- YouTube sources exhibit both strong positive and strong negative polarization.
- The most polarized content is concentrated in video-based sources.

This stacked bar chart displays the **average sentiment composition** for each source.

**Key takeaways:**
- Neutral sentiment dominates across all sources.
- YouTube content allocates a larger share to positive and negative sentiment.
- Mixed sentiment remains consistently small.

#### Summary of Findings

Across all figures and tables:

- Written news articles present monetary policy decisions in a predominantly neutral tone.
- YouTube news content exhibits stronger emotional framing and greater sentiment variance.
- Differences in sentiment are driven more by **content format** than by publisher identity.

These results suggest that the medium plays a central role in shaping sentiment around economic news.

## AWS Cost Estimation

The analysis was conducted using AWS free-tier and low-cost managed services. Estimated costs include both final execution and trial-and-error runs during development.

| Service | Approximate Usage | Estimated Cost |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Amazon Translate | ~25,000 characters | ~$0.38 |
| Amazon Comprehend | ~20 API calls | ~$0.02 |
| Amazon Transcribe | ~900 seconds audio | ~$0.36 |
| **Total** |  | **~$0.09** |


Minor variations in sentiment scores may occur due to updates in AWS managed models.
